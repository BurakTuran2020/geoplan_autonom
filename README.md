# geoplan_autonom
Trajectory generation in discrete time for the geographical mapping of the river network, optimization of the path generated by the mission planner to reduce the power consumption of the drone . The UAV will capture a large amount of data which will then be used to study the effects of global warming and how do these river networks come into existence and how they change as the water level rises over the years. All the codes are written in MATLAB and simulated using SIMULINK

to run the code just run the Main Trajectory Control file with the required gains.
The related plots for results are in th emain folder alonside all the codes
